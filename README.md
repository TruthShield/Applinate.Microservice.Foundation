## Introduction

Building a digital product is expensive, risky, and hard to get right.

- Complexity balloons exponentially like a runaway freight train, so the longer your code base is around, the closer you get to disaster derailments.  As a matter of fact, even large tech companies have needed to rebuild products from scratch (e.g., Apple, Facebook, Twitter, Ebay, and more).
- Quality crumbles rapidly because your solution is only as good as your weakest link, which means a single change can break your system and put you out of business.
- Across the industry, software production efficiency is low and failure rates are high, creating a lot of stress while wasting your limited time and money.

While large companies can (sometimes) survive software requiring a rebuild, for most, it's a death march.

Want to avoid these typical software product problems?

With a well-designed software architecture, you can. 

Want a framework for building top-quality software that's easy to scale, maintain, and change, so you won’t have to scrap everything and rebuild from scratch?  

[Applinate](https://applinate.com) is [Truth Shield](https://truthshield.io)'s microservice toolset used on all our projects.  And, I hope it helps you avoid many of the typical technical challenges in software production today.

And when you stop to think about it, doesn’t it make sense to isolate what you know will change, so you can swap out parts of your system without throwing out the baby with the bathwater?

This is where `Applinate` shines.

Using Applinate, your team has proven guidelines to produce sustainable, scalable, and high-quality distributed microservices.  You can use Applinate today to extend your project or quickly build something new.
- Establish guardrails for building agile software. Everyone knows technology and business move at different rates.  Applinate helps you isolate changes between things that change independently so your product can evolve, which significantly extends the life of your code base (and may save your company).
- Construct your system on a bedrock of proven architectural patterns. Applinate leverages decades of knowledge, experience, and best practices from seasoned software architects. This way, your teams bypass unnecessary learning curves and mistakes, helping you avoid severe headaches (or worse) down the road.
- Boost your teams’ productivity. Applinate gives you tools for encryption, compression, distributed messaging (CQRS/PubSub), caching, logging, and more, so you don’t waste time reinventing the wheel.
- Prevent tech, vendor, and implementation lock-in. Applinate gives you a plugin convention to make it easy to build alternative implementations for any aspect of your system, so you don’t get locked into anything that doesn’t work for you.
- Stop software rot. Applinate helps you separate your implementation from your interfaces. Your implementation can be (and should be) internal (only accessed through an interface), so you prevent unnecessary coupling, significantly extending the life of your products.

With `Applinate`, you build on top of scalable, flexible, and proven microservice conventions designed to make your life easier.

For example,testing, maintenance, and product evolution are simplified using Applinate.

Want a flexible, scalable, and free (open-source) microservice framework?  

Build with `Applinate` today to extend your product's life and prevent expensive rebuilds while adding rocket fuel to your teams productivity.

## How It Works

Applinate helps you build sustainable, scalable, and high-quality distributed microservices.  You can use Applinate to extend your current project or quickly build something new.

- **Build agile software.**  Everyone knows technology and business move at different rates.  Applinate helps you isolate changes between things that change independently, so you can evolve them separately, which significantly extends the life of your code base.
- **Informed architecture.**  Applinate leverages decades of knowledge, experience, and best practices from seasoned software architects so you avoid unnecessary learning curves and mistakes which helps you avoid serious headaches down the road.
- **Boost your productivity.** Out of the box, Applinate gives you tools for encryption, compression, distributed messaging (CQRS/PubSub), caching, logging, and more, so you don’t waste time reinventing the wheel.  
- **Prevent lock-in.**  Applinate provides a plugin convention allowing you to easily provide alternative implementations for all tools, so you don’t get locked into any vendor or implementation.
- **Prevent leaky abstractions.**  Applinate helps your team separate implementation from interfaces. All your implementations can be (and should be) internal (only accessed through the interface) to avoid unnecessary coupling, which prevents your code base from rotting.
 
With Applinate, you build on top of scalable, flexible, and powerful microservice conventions designed to make your life easier.  For example, testing, maintenance, and product evolution are easier when you use Applinate.

Owing software products is painful. I'm giving you our core framework for free so you can build products faster and with less defects.  

My aim is to help you establish a solid base for a maintainable, scalable, and high-quality products which ultimately benefits everyone.

> NOTE: we are still in beta stages of open-sourcing our toolset for you.  So, you can expect more tools coming soon.

## Benefits

* Follow SOLID design principles from the ground-up to **ensure your team is following industry-standard software architecture design principles**.
* Use a simple prescriptive and battle-tested service taxonomy (strongly influnced by the [IDesign](https://idesign.net/) method) to **leverage best-of-breed and battle-tested software architecture patterns**.
* Isolate your business and infrastructure code to **drive down maintenance costs, future-proof your solutions, and increse your teams' productivity**.
* Build highly testable services as reusable building-blocks so you can **make sure your systems stay stable over years of continuous changes**.
* Isolate your concrete implementations so they **avoid leaky dependencies and stay loosly coupled over time to help prevent system degradation**.
* Prevent vendor lock-in with appropriate interfaces/abstractions so you **keep up with the latest tecnologies and stay competitive**.
* Use the CQRS pattern (or not... it's up to you) with an event-driven architecture so **your system can scale**.
* have an amazing local development experience for microservices so **your engineers get all the benefits of a monolith during development while easily configuring your services to run as isolated microservices run-time**.

I hope this repository helps you realize your vision faster with the same sustainable, scalable, and maintainable microservice architecture used on all [TruthShield](https://truthshield.io) projects.

# A Message From Matt

Welcome,

Thanks for taking a look at `Applinate`.

If you are reading this, I'm sure you know how stressful it is to execute software projects today. 

Even with today’s modern processes, less than one in ten projects succeed. Scope creeps, projects derail, and quality issues from poor design decision slow progress, blow budgets, and kill careers. 

I get it. I’ve been a software team lead for over 25 years and had my share of challenges with the most common problems in software production.

Here’s the thing: I know we can do better.

That's why I created TruthShield to help executives, founders, and anyone in charge of teams producing software avoid nasty surprises during a project, address the worst defects at their source before they become problems, and increase your teams’ productivity by optimizing pre-development activities to increase project success rates, decrease development time, cost, and risk, and see more success with less stress.

I’d love to help with any aspects of your software product development.  I have tools, processes, and techniques I'm sure you'll find useful.  And we can help you do it yourself, do it with you, or if you want to save time and money we can do it for you.  

Whether you want to boost your teams productivity or need any help bringing your vision to life, reach out today.  I'm here for you. 

I look forward to connecting and hearing where I can help.

Warm Regards,
